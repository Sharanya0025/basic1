        Hyper Text Markup Language
    </h1>
    <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        HTML tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets like <html> and normally come in pairs <html> </html>. The first tag of the pair is the opening or start tag, the next one the closing or end tag.Listed below are ONLY a few of the tags you will need to learn about in order to work on structuring your web pages.

    <h1>Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
        CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.
A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
